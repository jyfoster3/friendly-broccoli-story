Joel (jyfoster3) - My story

START OF STORY:
One day I was on the search for some broccoli. Some really good broccoli
to make a nice broccoli soup. I went to the local farmers market,
just to get the freshest broccoli I could find. All the vendors
were exceedingly nice. But then....

THERE IT WAS! It was a talking broccoli saying hi to me. I thought talking
broccoli only existed in the fairytales. Somehow, this broccoli seems to be
very friendly with me. 
Broccoli: Hey, what is your name?
Me: My name is Joel, what about yours?
Broccoli: If I tell you, would you not eat me?
 

Fear of getting too much attention, I bought this talking brocolli along  with others
and went home ASAP.
In the kitchen, I started to find out more about this brocolli
Brocolli: I knew! I knew! I am finally free!
Me: What happened? Are you trapped inside a vegetable?
Brocolli: Yes! After I lost to the wizard, he trapped my spirit. To hide me forever,
he put me in this brocolli, not even in a lamp! If you are the chosen one, you have the
magic word to free me from this body. And I can fulfill a wish of yours.
Suddenly, I felt some power inside of me. I yelled: CAULIFLOWER!

To be continued...
Cauliflower is so weak though. It has no power over brocolli. Brocolli is a strong green vegetable. Cauliflower is a disgusting beige color. Brocolli is a powerhouse.

The END
