Joel (jyfoster3) - My story

START OF STORY:
One day I was on the search for some broccoli. Some really good broccoli
to make a nice broccoli soup. I went to the local farmers market,
just to get the freshest broccoli I could find. All the vendors
were exceedingly nice. But then....

THERE IT WAS! It was a talking broccoli saying hi to me. I thought talking
broccoli only existed in the fairytales. Somehow, this broccoli seems to be
very friendly with me. 
Broccoli: Hey, what is your name?
Me: My name is Joel, what about yours?
Broccoli: If I tell you, would you not eat me?
